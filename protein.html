                <div class="sub-heading">How Much Protein Do You Need?</div>

                <div class="section-text">
                    As a calisthenics athlete, your protein needs are higher than the average person. Proper intake is crucial for muscle repair and building the strength to progress with skills like pull-ups, muscle-ups, and planches.

                <div class="timing-section">
                    <p><strong>Breakfast is a great start:</strong> Beginning your day with protein helps you feel full and provides the energy you need for a training session later on</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Post-Workout:</strong> After a calisthenics workout, your muscles need to repair. Consuming a protein-rich snack or shake within a couple of hours helps with muscle recovery and growth.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Spread it out:</strong> The most effective approach is to spread your protein intake across all your meals and snacks to ensure a steady supply of amino acids throughout the day.</p>
